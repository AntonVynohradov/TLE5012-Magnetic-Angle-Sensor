## Usage
Please follow the example sketches in the /examples directory in this library to learn more about the usage of the library. Especially, take care of the SPI and IÂ²C configuration of the sensor. For more information, please consult the datasheet [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Angle_Sensor_TLE5012B-UM-v01_02-en-UM-v01_02-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d46146d18cb40146ec2eeae4633b).
 For more information:
* see here for the sensors user manual [TLE5012B](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/magnetic-sensors/magnetic-position-sensors/angle-sensors/)
* you can find several application notes concerning the sensor position and disc magnet design on the same page
* there is a handy [pin out picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infineon/assets/master/Pictures/TLE5012B_Sensor_2Go_Pin_out.png)

## Installation of XMC
If you use a Sensor2Go evolution kit or any Infineon XMC microcontroller like the XMC1100 Boot Kit or the XMC4700 Relax Kit, than you must also
install the [XMC-for-Arduino library from here](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino).
The Sensor2Go will be recognized as MC1100 XMC 2Go.
